# InTurn
A Web Application that gives users tools to track their job application status in a more automated way.
After you build the chrome extension, it'll prompt you to sign up using your google account to use it.
After the sign-up, if you go to an internship application that uses greenhouse.io, the extension will detect the application, and you'll be able to press begin application on the extension. In return, the user information will be automatically filled through the database. Currently, there's only a one demo user, but it'll be trivial to add more users in future. After you pressed begin application, the application information like job title, company, date applied and status of your application is automatically shows up in a list item in the home page of the web application. You can filter through the application dynamically using the search bar.

Future additions:
Detailed view of other information like recruiter contact, date posted, application way, etc. on click on list items.
Sorting list items.
User creation and authentication.
